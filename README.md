# AHBTAPB
Introduction to AHB to APB Protocol Bridge Design

# About the AMBA Buses:
The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) specification defines a framework for designing high-performance embedded systems. It provides standardized protocols for communication between the various components of a microcontroller or SoC (System on Chip). The AMBA architecture includes three primary buses:
1.	Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)
2.	Advanced System Bus (ASB)
3.	Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)
Each bus is optimized for specific requirements and use cases, and together they form a complete system interconnect solution. Below is an overview of the AHB and APB buses relevant to the bridge design.

# Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB):
The AMBA AHB is designed to support high-speed, high-throughput system modules. It acts as the central backbone for high-performance communication in embedded systems, connecting components like processors, on-chip memory, and high-speed peripherals.

Key Features:
•	High performance: AHB supports pipelined operations, burst transfers, and efficient data streaming.
•	Single clock edge operation: Ensures ease of timing and high throughput.
•	Multimaster capability: Enables multiple masters like processors and DMA controllers to share the bus.
•	Synthesis-friendly: Optimized for synthesis and automated testing.


# Signals:
1.	HCLK: Clock signal that times all bus transfers, with all signals synchronized to its rising edge.
2.	HRESETn: Active-low reset signal used to reset the system and bus.
3.	HADDR[31:0]: 32-bit address bus used by the master to specify the target address.
4.	HTRANS[1:0]: Indicates the transfer type (e.g., NONSEQUENTIAL, SEQUENTIAL, IDLE, BUSY).
5.	HWRITE: Specifies whether the current transfer is a write (HIGH) or read (LOW).
6.	HSIZE[2:0]: Indicates the data size (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit).
7.	HWDATA[31:0]: Data bus used to transfer data from the master to the slave during write operations.
8.	HRDATA[31:0]: Data bus used by slaves to send data to the master during read operations.
9.	HREADY: Indicates the completion of a transfer; can be de-asserted (LOW) to extend it.
10.	HRESP[1:0]: Provides the status of a transfer (e.g., OKAY, ERROR, RETRY, SPLIT).
The AHB is designed for system-wide high-speed communication and forms the backbone for on-chip data transfer.

# Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)
The AMBA APB is tailored for low-power, low-speed peripherals like UARTs, GPIOs, and timers. It simplifies communication with such peripherals while maintaining low power consumption and interface complexity.

Key Features:
•	Low power: Optimized for energy efficiency.
•	Simple interface: Minimal signal set for reduced complexity.
•	Two-cycle transfers: All read and write operations require two clock cycles.
•	Peripheral compatibility: Allows easy integration of a wide range of low-speed peripherals.
 

# Signals:
1.	PCLK: Clock signal used to time all transfers on the APB.
2.	PRESETn: Active-low reset signal for resetting the APB.
3.	PADDR[31:0]: Address bus driven by the APB bridge to select the target peripheral.
4.	PSELx: Peripheral select signal that activates the intended APB slave.
5.	PENABLE: Strobe signal indicating the second cycle of an APB transfer.
6.	PWRITE: Specifies whether the transfer is a write (HIGH) or read (LOW).
7.	PRDATA[31:0]: Data bus used by the APB slave to send data to the bridge during a read operation.
8.	PWDATA[31:0]: Data bus driven by the bridge to send data to the APB slave during a write operation.
   
APB is often used in conjunction with AHB, where an AHB-to-APB bridge facilitates the interaction between high-speed and low-speed components.


# Architecture of AHB-to-APB Bridge:
The AHB-to-APB bridge serves as an intermediary module that translates high-speed transactions on the AHB into low-speed transactions suitable for the APB. Its design can be broadly divided into the following blocks:

1.	AHB Master: Drives the input to AHB Slave Interface.

2.	AHB Slave Interface:
•	Captures incoming transactions from the AHB master.
•	Interprets control signals such as HWRITE, HADDR, HSIZE, and HBURST.

3.	APB Controller : 
•	Initiates transactions on the APB.
•	Provides address (PADDR), data (PWDATA), and control signals (PWRITE, PSEL).
 
4.	APB Controller Interface: The APB Controller Interface facilitates communication between the APB Controller and APB slaves, handling address decoding, data transfer, and peripheral selection signals.

5.	Top Module( Bridge Top ):
•	Transfers data between AHB and APB in compliance with their respective protocols.
•	Ensures proper buffering and timing to avoid data loss.

# Key Features of AHB-to-APB Bridge:

Efficiency in Data Transfer:
The bridge ensures minimal latency when converting AHB transactions to APB transactions while maintaining data integrity.
1.	Compatibility:
It supports the entire range of AHB and APB protocols, making it a versatile component in SoC designs.
2.	Low Complexity:

4.	Synchronization:
The bridge resolves clock domain differences, enabling reliable data transfer between AHB and APB.
